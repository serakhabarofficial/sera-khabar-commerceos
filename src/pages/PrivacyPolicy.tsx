            <p>
              We retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide
              the Service. If you delete your account, we will delete or anonymise your personal

            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-3">
              <li>All data in transit is encrypted via TLS 1.2+</li>

              <li>Multi-tenant isolation is enforced at the application layer — each organisation can only access its own data</li>
              <li>Rate limiting is applied to all API endpoints via Redis to prevent abuse</li>

              No method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.
