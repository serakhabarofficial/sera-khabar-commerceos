# Changelog

## [0.2.0.0] - 2026-10-24

### Added

- Team Inbox brings staff channels and private direct messages into the Merchant Suite, with unread counts, online and typing indicators, reactions, and message retries. Admins can create channels and manage their members.
- Tag orders by number, customer name, or phone with @, then open the order from its card beside the conversation.

### Fixed

- Switching between loaded conversations no longer replays loading skeletons or entrance fades.
- Retried sends cannot duplicate messages or move read receipts backward. Hidden mobile threads keep their unread counts, and every failed message retains its retry control.

### Database

- Adds five service-role-only chat tables with row-level security and member-scoped conversation summaries. The three Team Inbox migrations are already applied to the Sera Khabar project.

## [0.1.0.72] - 2026-10-16

### Fixed

- Bulk website orders are held for a call. An order with more than 20 units in total now raises a high "Bulk quantity" signal and is held as "Bulk quantity from a customer we have not delivered to", unless we have already delivered to that customer. Good courier history from other merchants does not exempt it. Before this, a prank order for 100 packs scored 10 and went through.
- The abuse list now recognises common crude Bangla and English words, including "পায়খানা". Matching is whole-word only, so names and places such as "বালক" or "বালুচর" are not flagged.

## [0.1.0.71] - 2026-10-10

### Fixed

- The dashboard no longer freezes for up to two minutes when several staff have Orders open. Overlapping full order loads used up every database connection, so other pages, including the login check, waited until they finished.
  - A full Orders load now reads order items in pages of 1,000, about 8 database queries instead of about 38.
  - When several staff tabs ask for the full list at the same moment, the server reads it once and sends everyone the same result.
  - Open tabs reload the whole list every 30 minutes instead of 10 and fetch only changed orders in between. A deleted order still triggers a full reload right away.

### Database

- Migration `20261010091516` adds indexes on orders and order items by last change, so the per-minute check for changed orders no longer reads every order. Additive and already applied to the Mango Lover BD database.

## [0.1.0.70] - 2026-10-09

### Added

- Follow up lists **delivery problems**: when Steadfast reports "Delivery attempt failed" or a rider writes a note ("কাস্টমার ফোন রিসিভ করেনি", "Rtn hobe"), the parcel shows in Follow up with the rider's own words until Steadfast confirms it Delivered or Cancelled. Hover a note to read it in full; each row also says how long it has waited.
- Follow up has four reason tiles (Delivery problem, No movement, In transit too long, Steadfast doesn't know) with a count and bar each; click to filter, Show all to reset. The list is newest first.
- **Mark followed up**: tick the parcels you called, add an optional note, and they leave Follow up for 2 days (sooner if the rider reports something new). The order's log records who, when and the note; the status is never changed.
- A one-time catch-up from Steadfast's tracking history (`scripts/steadfast-tracking-catchup.mjs`, already run) marked 180 parcels that were really moving as In transit and recorded 100 rider-reported problems.

### Database

- Migrations `20261009121557` (rider problem note, and keeping a supplied movement time) and `20261009123421` (who followed up, when, note), both additive and already applied to the Mango Lover BD database.

## [0.1.0.69] - 2026-10-09

### Added

- Orders has a **Follow up** tab (between In-Transit and Delivered) for parcels that need a call: in Processing for more than 4 days without moving, in transit for more than 5 days without delivery, or marked "unknown" by Steadfast. Each one says why ("No movement for 4 days", "In transit for 6 days", "Steadfast doesn't know: ask Steadfast support"). Home's attention card and quick action point to it ("N parcels to follow up").
- The Steadfast webhook keeps the courier's latest note on each parcel (for example "Customer not reachable"), without changing any status, so delivery problems can be added to Follow up once their wording is known.
- Orders record when they entered Processing and when their courier status last changed, stamped by the database and backfilled from history (migration `20261009074910`, already applied to the Mango Lover BD database).

### Removed

- The Flagged tab. Risky customers keep the red High Risk badge in their normal tab; parcels Steadfast marks "unknown" move to Follow up.

## [0.1.0.68] - 2026-10-09

### Changed

- Steadfast now updates orders only through its webhook, and only to In transit, Delivered or Cancelled. A tracking update marks the parcel In transit; a confirmed delivery or partial delivery marks it Delivered; a confirmed cancellation marks it Cancelled and cancels the order like a manual cancel. The team's own statuses (approved, print, processing) are never changed, and every other Steadfast status or event (pending, in review, the rider's unconfirmed reports, cancel/return requests, payouts) is ignored. A delivered or cancelled order never moves back.
- The webhook checks both the shared token and Steadfast's signature, and answers with an error when the database fails so Steadfast retries the update instead of losing it.
- Home no longer refreshes Steadfast statuses when it opens (Pathao's refresh stays); it reached only a handful of orders a day and could undo the team's statuses.
- The Analytics funnel goes Visits → Product → Checkout → Order → Delivered, and each stage counts visits that reached it or went further, so it never goes backwards. Add to cart is shown on its own, because Buy now and landing pages skip the cart. The biggest-drop advice follows the new stages.

### Fixed

- Landing pages (/step/...) count as product views; past landing-page views were backfilled (migration `20261009065448`, already applied to the Mango Lover BD database).
- Orders staff create from an abandoned checkout are linked to the shopper's website visit, so they show in the funnel and source reports (migration `20261008173522`, already applied). Needs the matching storefront change, which forwards the visit with each checkout capture.
- The Funnel tab says how many website orders in the range are not linked to a visit.
- A one-time catch-up (`scripts/steadfast-status-catchup.mjs`) applied the missed Delivered and Cancelled outcomes from before the webhook was connected: 1,184 orders updated, none of the team's statuses changed.

## [0.1.0.67] - 2026-10-08

### Added

- Orders made with Create order can change their source later from the order page (Order source picker, saved with Save changes). Storefront, inbox and abandoned-checkout orders keep the source they arrived with, and the server rejects source changes on them.
- Every source change is logged with who made it and when: the order's Logs show "Order source: Phone → Facebook" and the Activity Log shows "Changed source from Phone to Facebook".

### Changed

- Home's metric sparklines look like Shopify's: each hour's (or day's) own value as a soft wave instead of a running total, a green (up) or red (down) gradient line that fades in from the left and ends in a dot, and the % change in the same colour. The hour still in progress is left out of the sparkline so it doesn't dip at the end.

## [0.1.0.66] - 2026-10-08

### Added

- Staff Performance shows each team member's handled orders by source (Website, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Phone, Telesales, Upsell, Manual / Other): handled, confirmed, cancelled, confirmation rate, delivered and value per source, with an outcome bar and an all-sources total. A source's confirmation rate is red when it is more than 5 points below the team's rate for that source, and green when it is the best on the team.
- Home's Order Protection card lists the latest held checkouts with customer, product and risk score.

### Changed

- Home's attention cards are tighter: the order list follows the description, shows 3 rows that are never cut off, and full-width buttons sit below it without a shadow.
- Home's channel filter uses the BoardUI dropdown with the brand logos from Settings, in a compact panel, and leaves no focus outline after a mouse close.

### Fixed

- Home loads in under a second again. Its sessions, conversion rate and their hourly/daily charts come from a new small database function (`analytics_home_sessions`, migrations `20261008083002` and `20261008085241`, both already applied to the Mango Lover BD database) instead of the full website report, which was timing out. If sessions are ever slow, Home shows "—" for them after 3 seconds instead of waiting.

## [0.1.0.65] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- Hovering Sessions, Total sales, Orders or Conversion rate on Home opens a chart of that metric over the period, like Shopify: the figure and its change, what it measures, and each hour (or day) against the comparison period as a dotted line. The chart code loads on first hover, so Home's first load is unchanged.
- Conversion rate is now tracked by the hour, so it has a sparkline and an hourly chart too. Needs the `20261006190000_website_report_hourly_conversion` migration (already applied to the Mango Lover BD database).

### Fixed

- Steadfast fraud history comes from Steadfast itself, using the shop's own Steadfast API keys, instead of FraudShield's copy, which sometimes showed 0 parcels for customers with Steadfast history. FraudShield still covers the other couriers and is used for Steadfast if Steadfast's API fails. Steadfast reports a range (e.g. "25+"), shown as such in the fraud panel and counted at its low end in totals.

## [0.1.0.64] - 2026-10-06

### Changed

- Home uses a lighter type scale: a smaller headline, normal-weight card titles and quick actions, and smaller metrics, Ask Edith text and globe card, so the page reads calmer and matches the rest of the app.

### Fixed

- Opening Orders from another page is smooth again. A 100-row table froze the page for about a second (5 frames in 1.5s), so the entrance jumped; the first 20 rows now show at once and the rest fill in after the entrance, and background order refreshes no longer freeze the page.
- The "Good afternoon!" greeting on Orders no longer rebuilds itself (and restarts its shimmer) every time the page updates.

## [0.1.0.63] - 2026-10-06

### Changed

- The Ask Edith bar on Home has raised, beveled buttons: the Edith icon is a mango badge that lifts on hover, and the send button is black, faded until there's a question, lifting on hover and pressing in on click.

## [0.1.0.62] - 2026-10-06

### Changed

- Every dashboard page opens instantly. Page code downloads in the background and opens with no loading screen; if a page isn't ready yet, only the page area shows a spinner and the sidebar stays. Hovering a sidebar link starts loading that page's data, and Overview, Customers, the social inboxes and Order Protection now show their last data at once when you come back.
- Orders opens instantly too: its orders and today's P&L load in the background from any page.
- Orders uses Home's dotted globe with your real live visitors (the old 3D globe showed demo locations) and is much lighter. The `cobe` package is removed.
- Orders opens with Home's entrance: the P&L cards rise together and their charts draw in, then the greeting, then the orders table.

### Fixed

- Visits opened in a background tab (new tab, Messenger or Facebook in-app preload) are now counted once the tab is shown. Before, those shoppers counted as live visitors with no pin on the globe and were missing from sessions and website reports.
- Crawlers that run JavaScript no longer count as live visitors.

## [0.1.0.61] - 2026-10-06

### Changed

- The Home globe now hops between live visitors' places like Shopify's: the pin flies to the next city as a small mango comet that curls in, its landing ripples through the map dots, and the "Live visitors" ring spins once on each landing. Reduced motion just swaps the pin.
- The Ask Edith bar on Home has a new "Mango glow" look: a pill with a mango-gradient edge, a warm glow that deepens on focus, and a round send button that turns black once there's a question.

### Fixed

- The Orders page no longer lags. A globe library was rewriting a stylesheet on every frame, restyling the whole page and holding it at about 16fps; it now runs at about 60fps, so the sidebar hover is smooth.
- Hovering the collapsed sidebar slides it over the page instead of pushing the page aside, and the Fulfillment Queue no longer draws on top of it.
- The logo in the collapsed sidebar is centered in a square box instead of being pushed right and clipped.
- The date picker no longer has empty space under its Reset / Cancel / Apply row.

## [0.1.0.60] - 2026-10-06

### Changed

- Home opens smoothly: the greeting, Ask Edith bar, quick actions and cards fade and rise in a short cascade, the numbers count up from 0, the sparklines draw in and the globe fades in. All of it is skipped with reduced motion.
- The Home globe sits higher, so its whole lower curve shows above the cards, and its soft glow fades into the page.
- Narrower side margins on Home.

### Fixed

- The live visitor pin no longer flickers. It moves with a sub-pixel transform, stays put while every visitor is in the same city, and isn't hidden again when the data refreshes.

## [0.1.0.59] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- A new Home page opens the dashboard. It shows today's sessions, total sales, orders and conversion rate against yesterday up to the same time, with smooth running-total charts and numbers that roll when they change. "Today" opens the date picker and "All channels" filters sales and orders by order source; money figures stay admin-only.
- A dotted globe pins where live visitors are browsing from, city by city. Adds two nullable coordinate columns to website visits and a server-only `live_visitor_locations` function; older visits are placed by their Bangladeshi district.
- Up to three "needs attention" cards rank what to do next (flagged orders, Order Protection holds, orders ready for courier, unanswered chats, orders to confirm, inbox orders, abandoned checkouts, returns), with quick actions and insights on quiet days.
- An "Ask Edith" bar on Home opens Ask Edith with the question already sent.

### Changed

- The orders dashboard moved from `/` to `/orders` and is listed as Orders, with its own icon, under Home in the sidebar and mobile navigation.
- The order status rules behind the Orders queues are shared with the server, so Home's counts always match the Orders page.

## [0.1.0.58] - 2026-10-06

### Fixed

- "On the site now" counts every shopper. Presence was kept in each server instance's memory, so the dashboard only saw the shoppers who happened to ping the same instance; it now lives in one shared Supabase table. Adds an unlogged, server-only `live_visitor_presence` table and two functions.
- The storefront tracker script is cached at Vercel's CDN, so a cold server no longer delays it and drops shoppers who leave in the first seconds.

### Changed

- Analytics opens on today (Dhaka time) instead of the last 30 days.

## [0.1.0.57] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- Team members can be switched off and on from Settings › Team. A switched-off member keeps their name and order history but loses access until switched back on; admins and your own account can't be switched off.
- Each team member can have a post (Moderator, Order Manager, Customer Support, Packer, Delivery Coordinator or a custom one), set from their row or while adding them. Adds two nullable columns to user roles.
- Removing a team member now asks for confirmation in an animated warning that offers to switch them off instead and closes itself after 12 seconds if left alone.

### Changed

- Adding a team member is a three-step popup: who they are, what they'll do, then their login details to share.
- Settings › Integrations is redesigned: Meta Business on top with its Pages, Instagram, WhatsApp and ad accounts at a glance, then "Your stack" for what's connected and "Add to your stack" for the rest, with full-colour brand logos.
- Settings › Workspace matches the new look, with a highlighted business name card and a visible Edit name button.
- The storefront deploy and custom domain settings are hidden for now.
- Switched-off team members no longer appear in the order assignee list.

## [0.1.0.56] - 2026-10-04

### Added

- Advance / partial payments can record where the money came from (bKash, Nagad, Rocket or Bank) and a TrxID or the sender's last 4 digits, on New Order, order editing and the abandoned-checkout editor. Both are optional, are cleared when the advance is removed, and show in the order's activity history.
- Order Protection › Attempts: search by customer name, phone (01… or +880…) or order number across all attempts, not just the loaded page.

### Changed

- Order Protection › Attempts is redesigned as cards showing the full phone number, order number and IP address, with Fake, Block phone and Block device right on each card. The investigation opens in a smoothly animated side drawer, blocking asks for a reason in place of a browser popup, and you can page back to newer attempts.
- The Attempts summary counts the last 30 days across the whole workspace (held, blocked, not labelled, marked fake) instead of only the 50 loaded rows.
- Blocked and allowed phones and devices are managed from Attempts ("Blocked & allowed"); the separate Lists tab is gone.
- Overview KPI cards have a new light card design with a stepped trend line; Delivery Success and Pending Fulfillment now chart real daily values, Profit Margin charts daily margin %, and hovering shows each day's value and date.
- Home P&L cards chart each period's amount as a smooth graphite curve (single-day ranges in 3-hour blocks), with hover tooltips.
- Business Report moved to the bottom of the Reports section in the sidebar.

### Fixed

- An advance entered in the abandoned-checkout editor was silently discarded; it is now saved on the order the checkout converts into.

## [0.1.0.55] - 2026-10-04

### Changed

- Campaign Links has a new colourful look: each metric keeps one colour across the page, the totals cards show small pill bar trends, the funnel is a centred stack of coloured pills with gauges for the conversion rates, and daily performance draws clicks as rounded bars with orders as a line.
- Delivered revenue by channel uses each channel's brand colour and has its own panel.
- Each link in the table shows its daily click trend in its channel colour.

### Added

- "When people click": a heatmap of clicks by Dhaka weekday and two-hour slot that names the busiest time. Team members see it too, since it contains only click counts.

## [0.1.0.54] - 2026-10-04

### Changed

- Sidebar menu rows and section labels (Main Menu, Orders, Catalog…) sit a little closer together.
- The dashboard scrolls as one page again, header included, and bounces naturally at the top and bottom. The area revealed by the bounce now matches the dashboard background instead of showing a darker grey band.

## [0.1.0.53] - 2026-10-04

### Changed

- Campaign links redirect faster: the storefront now answers `/go/*` links right away and records the click in the background. Merchant Suite accepts those signed click records, saves each click once even if it is sent twice, and links an order to its click even when the buyer checks out within seconds.
- Editing or creating a campaign link refreshes the storefront's cached copy of that link immediately.

## [0.1.0.52] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed

- Campaign link popup: the Opens dropdown now opens upward with a properly positioned chevron, and the custom path field sits above the dropdown.
- Sidebar search now opens the same smooth popup card as New link (⌘K still works), with all nav icons showing.
- Dismiss confirmations in the abandoned tab now open and close with the same smooth animation as the New link popup.
- Campaign Links header: the date picker and New link button are now the same height.

### Changed

- Sidebar collapse icon replaced (17px, matches the settings gear).
- Sidebar Analytics renamed to Business Analytics.

## [0.1.0.51] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- Resizable sidebar: drag its right edge to make it wider (192px to 320px), so long labels and your full name fit. The width is remembered in this browser. Double-click the edge to reset it, drag far left to minimise it, or focus the edge and use the arrow keys.

## [0.1.0.50] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed

- Pages no longer bounce or slide past the top and bottom. The dashboard fills the screen, only the content panel scrolls, and the header stays in place.

## [0.1.0.49] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed

- Sidebar menu items now match the width of the search bar and logo card, with the same gap on both sides, and their icons line up with the search icon.

## [0.1.0.48] - 2026-10-03

### Changed

- The redesigned sidebar is back to its original width: 192px open and 44px minimised. Rows return to their earlier compact size so labels fit.

## [0.1.0.47] - 2026-10-03

### Changed

- Redesigned sidebar: a light warm panel with a Mango Lover BD logo card, a search bar below it, and sections for Main Menu, Orders (Returns, Customer List, Order Protection), Catalog, Marketing, Social Inbox and Reports. Tree lines and the minimised icon rail work as before.
- The bottom of the sidebar shows your name and role (Admin or Team member) with the account menu, a two-tone settings gear, and the minimise arrow, which moved from the top.

### Added

- Search the sidebar (or press ⌘K / Ctrl+K anywhere) to jump to any page you can open.

## [0.1.0.46] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- Merchant-Suite-only variants: untick "On website" when adding or editing a variant to keep it off the storefront. Hidden variants stay available for manual, inbox and courier orders, are left out of the public catalog and stock data, and website checkout refuses them.

## [0.1.0.45] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- Campaign Links: admins and team members can create, edit, copy, archive and restore shared links, with click-day reports, daily charts, checkout/order funnels and recent attributed orders. Costs, courier fees and estimated profit remain admin-only.
- Follow a campaign from its order-detail chip. New orders, captured checkouts and held orders retain validated 30-day attribution; late captures reconcile without changing an order's original campaign.
- Storefront campaign links preserve incoming URL parameters and fill missing UTMs automatically. Signed first-party cookies forward attribution through existing checkout and abandoned-cart paths; tracking failures never block shopping.

### Fixed

- Held-order approval retains the checkout draft hash even when the checkout capture arrives later, avoiding duplicate campaign funnel counts.

## [0.1.0.44] - 2026-09-30

### Added

- Customer profiles: click a customer (or "View customer profile" in the order editor) to open a full profile. The top card shows name, phone, Call / SMS / Create order, follow-up, the order that needs handling, address, channels, segments, next step, latest note and FraudShield.
- Tabs below it: Overview (delivered value, order outcomes, recent orders, top products), Orders (all orders with paging), Notes (team notes, manual tags and follow-up date) and Activity (saved order events).
- Follow-up dates use the Merchant Suite date picker, with Clear and Today.
- Order editor: "View customer profile" sits in the top bar next to the order number.

## [0.1.0.43] - 2026-09-30

### Added

- Abandoned tab: when a checkout's phone matches an order in the Pending tab, the row is tinted and shows an "Already ordered · #1234" badge (or "Already ordered · 2 pending") that links to the order.
- Abandoned editor: a banner says "Already ordered — #1234 is waiting in Pending", with a link to each order. It follows the phone field as you edit.

## [0.1.0.42] - 2026-09-30

### Fixed

- Order search now finds an order when you type its number the way it is shown, with a leading "#" (for example #ML-152172). Before, only ML-152172 or 152172 matched.

## [0.1.0.41] - 2026-09-30

### Added

- Abandoned editor: pick Abandoned, Pending, On hold or Approved under Final total, then one button saves your edits, moves the checkout into that order tab and returns you to the Abandoned tab. On hold asks for a hold reason first, and Approved checks the name and address. Dismiss sits on the left with a confirmation. Ctrl/Cmd+Enter submits.

### Changed

- Orders created from an abandoned checkout now show "Abandoned" as their source in the orders list and on the order page, in a rose badge. The stored source stays "website", so reports and filters are unchanged.

### Fixed

- The order page's Send message templates now use the final total including delivery, minus any advance payment. The dialog labels it "Amount due" when an advance was paid.

## [0.1.0.40] - 2026-09-29

### Changed

- Staff Performance: Team performance is now a roster and profile. The left list ranks each person with their confirmed value, an outcome bar and a "High cancels" tag; selecting someone opens their profile with confirmation and cancel rates against the team, delivered rate, average order value, weight, extra revenue, where their orders ended up, extra revenue and abandoned carts, and products by outcome. A Team total card sits under the roster, and a Sort by menu covers every metric. Members with no orders collapse into one line, and anyone who only worked abandoned carts stays in the list.
- Staff Performance: the Order yield chart is now tick-mark bars, one row per person, with a dashed team-average line and a red delivered rate for anyone well below the team.

### Fixed

- Delivered and rate columns no longer show a green "best" on every row when all members tie, for example everyone at 0% delivered.
- A member exactly 5 points off the team average is no longer flagged because of floating-point rounding.

## [0.1.0.39] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- Customers: select customers with checkboxes or by clicking a row, then send a personalised SMS through Bulk SMS BD with audience templates (Thank you, New season, We miss you, Special offer, Back in stock, Feedback, Eid greeting), a credit estimate and a confirm step. Up to 500 customers per send; recipients are resolved on the server from the workspace's own orders.
- Customers: product filter with product images, a Last order column (newest first by default), page-number pagination (50 per page), and a reset × on every filter.
- Date picker: a Reset button in the calendar, a reset × on the toolbar trigger, and Solar duotone preset icons.

### Fixed

- Customers page read only the newest 1,000 orders because of the Supabase row limit, undercounting customers (955 instead of 1,759) and repeat buyers. Orders are now read in pages, including for bulk SMS.
- Customer sources now use each order's own source (Website, Facebook, Telesales, Phone, Upsell, WhatsApp, Manual / Other) instead of labelling every order with a `shopify_order_id` as Shopify. A customer's main source is the channel they ordered through most.

### Changed

- Business Report and Staff Performance charts use a colour palette for channels, staff and products, with mango highlighting the peak hour, best day and top performer, and a stronger intake-rhythm scale.
- Customers: the profile popup is removed; clicking a customer selects it.

## [0.1.0.38] - 2026-09-28

### Fixed

- Customer phone copy controls now show the confirmation tick during the click, and the customer list renders in 50-row batches to avoid long interaction stalls on large audiences.

### Changed

- Business Report product weight rows now show ordered and approved kilograms and pack counts separately, plus an outcome mix bar and legend.

## [0.1.0.37] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- Business Report redesign: summary tiles with sparklines and changes against the previous period, an hour-of-day intake grid, a source-to-outcome flow chart, a source mix donut, an approval gauge with an outcome breakdown, a best-day chart, and product weight rings.
- Source performance is now a sortable table with approval, loss, average order value and net delivery per source. Clicking a row opens its landing pages and a products-by-outcome kg breakdown (approved, pending, cancelled, RTO).
- Delivery economics shows per-order averages and how many orders have courier fees and weight recorded.

### Changed

- The business report API returns an hour-of-day profile, per-bucket website value, weight and outcome counts, and a previous-period summary. A "Today" view is compared with the same elapsed time the day before.

## [0.1.0.36] - 2026-09-27

### Added

- On Hold orders now require a reason, keep hold details separate from customer notes, and can return to Pending the day after a customer-requested date. Activity history records the hold and automatic release.
- Orders now require a customer name, phone number, and delivery address before approval, whether created manually, edited, or converted from an abandoned checkout.

### Changed

- Order source is read-only after creation. Cancellation-reason options and the empty prompt now appear in Bengali, with the reason menu opening above its trigger.

## [0.1.0.35] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- Keep the Packing Summary print document available while the browser preview or PDF save is open; clear the prior document when a new print job starts.

## [0.1.0.34] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- Print tab gets the same bottom Previous/Next order navigator as the Pending tab (`N of M print`, print-orders only). The order queue is now per-tab with separate snapshots.

## [0.1.0.33] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- Advance / partial payment on New Order and the Order editor: inline ৳ input (empty at zero, capped at the total), green due chip, and `Paid` state at full payment. The orders table Total shows the due with a small adv chip, the invoice shows Advance paid + Amount due, and Steadfast/Pathao collect the due only.

## [0.1.0.32] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- Abandoned-checkout convert now matches variant-suffixed cart names (e.g. `Katimon Mango (6KG)`) to catalog products via exact, stripped, and fuzzy match, and persists resolved `product_id`/`variant_id` into `order_items` so warehouse routing and weight stay linked.
- Product warehouse reassignment now resyncs open auto-routed orders (`warehouse_auto = true`): bulk-assign, single product edit, and warehouse delete re-resolve affected orders and return `resynced_orders`. Manual overrides and dispatched/final orders are never touched.

## [0.1.0.31] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- Order and abandoned-checkout editors now have an **Order details | Logs** switch. Logs slides in with the order's full, always-expanded activity history, updates live every 2 seconds while open, and opens instantly because activity is loaded with the page.
- Logs explain changes at a glance: status changes show before and after status chips, item edits show a summary with the total difference plus Added, Removed, quantity, and discount chips with taka impact, and other field edits read as `Label before → after`.

### Changed

- The compact activity timeline was removed from the customer panel; the Logs tab replaces it. Unsaved edits are kept when switching tabs, and `?tab=logs` reopens Logs after a reload.
- Legacy variant names stored as JSON, such as `{"size":"১ কেজি"}`, now display as readable text in Logs.

## [0.1.0.30] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- Added Staff Performance to Overview with assigned, confirmed, value, delivery-rate, and top-staff metrics.
- Added Pending Fulfillment as an actionable Overview KPI with period-over-period comparison.

### Changed

- Expanded Courier Performance with shipment totals, status breakdowns, and delivery pipeline shares.
- Expanded Retention with average orders per customer and average customer value.
- Aligned the Overview operational cards and anchored their final sections to the shared card height.

## [0.1.0.29] - 2026-09-23

### Changed

- Sidebar navigation now uses Geist Sans, 13px primary labels, calmer active and inactive contrast, a slightly wider layout, Reports above Intelligence, and the shorter Staff label.

### Removed

- Removed Billing & Plan, the copyright/help controls, and the FraudShield usage summary from their respective interfaces.

## [0.1.0.28] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- Detailed per-order activity history for regular, inbox, and abandoned orders, including immutable provenance, actor attribution, structured change reasons, before/after values, meaningful-view deduplication, and operational events for printing, messaging, fraud checks, and courier actions.
- Compact expandable activity timelines that show five recent events by default, semantic BoardUI chips, exact timestamps, and full-history access.
- Staff performance reporting for retained upsell value and detailed order activity.

### Changed

- Order and inbox editors now require structured reasons for audited item additions and cancellations, group save events, and recover safely from stale-write conflicts.
- Main Cancel actions in the existing-order and new-order editors now use the BoardUI ghost button.

## [0.1.0.27] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- Pending Previous/Next navigation now appears when an order is opened in a new tab from the Dashboard Pending tab: the queue snapshot persists to localStorage with a `?fulfillmentTab=pending` link tag and a 30-minute expiry.

## [0.1.0.26] - 2026-09-22

### Added

- Activity Log report (`/reports/activity`) — a chronological, filterable feed of every staff confirm/cancel/contact/dismiss/convert action across orders, inbox orders, and abandoned carts, with the same design language as Staff Performance and Business Report.
- Per-order activity timeline embedded on the order editor, the abandoned-checkout editor, and an inbox-order popover, so "who did what" is visible on the order itself, not just the report.
- `order_status_events` now also records abandoned-checkout Contacted/Dismissed/Reopened actions, closing the only order-shaped table with no staff attribution.
- Staff Performance now reports abandoned-cart handling per staff member — Contacted, Dismissed, Reopened, and Converted counts plus converted value — as its own detail group and a quick-glance chip on each staff card.

### Fixed

- Converting an abandoned checkout into an order (`POST /api/abandoned-checkouts/:id/convert`) now stamps `created_by`, `assigned_to`, and confirmation attribution and writes the matching audit events — previously the resulting order had no recorded confirmer at all.

## [0.1.0.25] - 2026-09-22

### Added

- Dashboard order IDs now open the existing order editor in a new tab on desktop and mobile while preserving the current Dashboard state and existing same-tab row/card navigation.

## [0.1.0.24] - 2026-09-22

### Changed

- Serve stock-free public product catalogs from a 30-second shared cache while keeping browsers uncached and inventory on its separate five-second endpoint.
- Vary cached catalog responses by request origin so CORS headers cannot be shared between storefront origins.

### Fixed

- Purge and warm public catalog URLs after published product and variant catalog changes, including ordinary product edits, while leaving stock-only edits on the short inventory cache.

## [0.1.0.23] - 2026-09-21

### Added

- Order editor "Last orders" entries are clickable cards that open the order in the editor (dashboard tab preserved), showing CN No, courier, and color-coded courier-status chips (BoardUI Chip) in a balanced two-column layout.

## [0.1.0.22] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- Order editor saves failing with "UPDATE requires a WHERE clause": the `replace_order_items` discount refresh updated its temp table with no `WHERE` clause, which the managed project rejects. Added an always-true predicate (every row carries a product or variant id at that point). Canonical migration `20260921000000_fix_replace_order_items_where_guard.sql`.
- Dashboard order tabs resetting to All Orders after opening an order: the tab now travels in navigation state from the table to the order editor and back, with a per-session fallback so browser-back returns to the same tab.

### Changed

- Redesigned the date-range preset list (Staff Performance, Business Report, Dashboard, Overview): grouped icon rows (All Time/Today/Yesterday, Last 7/30/90 Days, This Week/Month, Last Month, This Year) with dividers and a blue selected highlight; compact sizing to match the calendar height.
- Dashboard date picker dropdown now opens centered below its trigger; other pages keep the right-aligned placement.
- Yesterday preset uses a custom circular history-arrow icon.

## [0.1.0.21] - 2026-09-21

### Added

- New Order page now supports per-item discounts (fixed amount or percentage, same editor as the Order editor) and an overall cart discount, instead of a single fixed-amount discount field.
- `POST /api/orders` accepts and validates per-item `discount_type`/`discount_value`, computes `unit_discount` server-side, and verifies the aggregate discount never exceeds the merchandise subtotal (recomputes `price`/`quantity` from the items).

### Changed

- New Order cart restructured to match the Order editor: scrollable item list on top, pinned summary below (Delivery, discount, Subtotal, Advance, Final total, compact payment dropdown, note icon with dropdown editor, Cancel/Create order buttons inside the card).
- Adding a product auto-scrolls the cart to the new line for preview; the page toolbar sticks on scroll and the workspace fills the viewport height.

## [0.1.0.20] - 2026-09-21

### Changed

- Redesign the New Order page's left column into two self-contained cards ("Customer details" and "Order settings") matching the Courier Delivery panel's header style, with leading icons on the Name/Phone/Address fields and a "New customer" reset button, instead of one stretched field grid with dead vertical gaps.
- Grow the Delivery address textarea so the left column's height sits closer to the right panel's when a customer has a handful of couriers with data.
- Cap the FraudShield "By courier" list at 4 visible rows (sorted by parcel volume) on all three order-editor pages; the rest collapse into a "+N more couriers" trigger that reveals them on hover instead of listing every courier unbounded.

## [0.1.0.19] - 2026-09-21

### Changed

- Redesign the FraudShield risk panel on the Order editor, Abandoned order editor, and New order pages: a "Courier Delivery" header with a compact "Last updated" re-check button, and six flat `#e8e8e6` stat cards (Safe/Caution/High, success rate, delivered, cancelled, total, risk score) laid out 3-up/3-down instead of the old inline chip row.

## [0.1.0.18] - 2026-09-21

### Changed

- Make FraudShield courier logos in the order-editor risk panel bigger and legible (wide wordmark slot with multiply blending instead of a cramped 20px square).
- Tighten the left/right/top page margins on the Order editor, Abandoned order editor, and New order pages so more of the panel is visible without scrolling.

## [0.1.0.17] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- Make bulk fraud verification cache-aware: the bulk buttons now send `force: false`, so numbers checked within the last 30 days reuse cache instead of re-spending a request each. Single checks still force a fresh lookup. The toast reports how many were reused from cache.

## [0.1.0.16] - 2026-09-21

### Changed

- Rebuild the date-range picker used on Overview, Dashboard, Staff Performance, and Business Report with BoardUI's dual-month calendar card: editable start/end date chips, a "N days selected" summary, and an explicit Cancel/Apply step for custom ranges. The trigger button (icon, date text, border) and one-click preset list (Today, Yesterday, Last 7 Days, etc.) are unchanged.

## [0.1.0.15] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- Disable the automated FraudShield warming cron (every 5 minutes, up to 40 phones per run over the last 7 days), which drained the daily FraudShield quota down to the 100-request reserve even with few new orders. The endpoint now fails closed with 410.
- Keep the order-editor fraud Check/Retry buttons enabled when the cached state says "Daily limit reached" — the cached message can be stale across the daily quota reset — and give quota-blocked numbers a force Retry that makes a live call.

## [0.1.0.14] - 2026-09-21

### Changed

- Give কালোজিরা মিক্সড | Kalojira Mixed free delivery, matching the existing honey products.

## [0.1.0.13] - 2026-09-20

### Changed

- Give Staff Performance and Business Report their own sidebar icons instead of sharing one.

## [0.1.0.12] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- Stretch Business Report day-granularity intake bars across the full chart width with single-line labels, so multi-day ranges read as clean as the hourly Today view.

## [0.1.0.11] - 2026-09-20

### Added

- Open the admin-only Business Report for regular-order intake, source performance, Website landing pages, and delivery economics over Dhaka-local date ranges, with an hourly chart for single days and daily buckets for longer ranges.
- Cover Business Report dates, outcome precedence, fulfillment fallback, fee coverage, and admin route wiring with regression tests.

### Fixed

- Reject Business Report ranges with future Dhaka dates or more than 366 days, and keep terminal courier returns ahead of legacy cancelled business status.
- Point the Staff Performance product-variants read at the shared report pagination helper after the base-branch merge.

## [0.1.0.10] - 2026-09-19

### Changed

- Review staff performance in a full-width, ranked regular-order card queue with team snapshots, color-coded outcome counts, and expandable operational detail.
- Keep Social Inbox metrics out of the Staff Performance page while preserving the underlying report response for future reporting work.
- Show the Dashboard / Staff Performance breadcrumb and a streamlined Staff Performance page header.

## [0.1.0.9] - 2026-09-18

### Added

- Attribute manually created and social inbox orders to the staff member who creates, is assigned, confirms, or cancels them, with immutable status-transition history.
- Add the Staff Performance report with role-safe staff filtering, Dhaka-local date ranges, and separate regular-order and social-inbox metrics.

### Fixed

- Keep staff reporting accurate for historical activity, courier-driven status changes, malformed legacy inbox items, and high-volume report queries.

## [0.1.0.8] - 2026-09-17

### Changed

- Manual Create Order submissions save directly as Approved instead of Pending.

## [0.1.0.7] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed

- Batch unbounded order id fetches that failed past URL limits, restoring the orders queue at higher order volumes.
- Remove the AI district fallback; harden the built-in matcher for misspellings, Bengali unicode variants, inserted spaces, and Bengali area names.

## [0.1.0.6] - 2026-09-17

### Added

- Add an Approved-tab district filter with per-district order counts and automatic AI resolution of unknown addresses that learns into org settings without touching order data.

## [0.1.0.5] - 2026-09-17

### Added

- Add a Packing Summary print action to the Dashboard Print tab: per-product/pack totals with order counts, total kg, and tick boxes, plus a multi-item exception list with order IDs and ticks.

## [0.1.0.4] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- Let staff choose an order source when creating an order and edit it later, including after courier dispatch.

### Changed

- Validate canonical order sources, normalize legacy Website values, and preserve source metadata across storefront order flows.

## [0.1.0.3] - 2026-09-14

### Changed

- Add a reversible `ORDER_PROTECTION_MODE=off` switch for temporarily bypassing storefront order protection.

## [0.1.0.2] - 2026-09-13

### Changed

- Classify dispatched Steadfast orders into Processing, In-Transit, or Flagged while showing their consignment ID in Processing.

## [0.1.0.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- Send an individual SMS to a saved order phone number from the order editor.
- Open a one-click WhatsApp chat for an order directly from its customer panel.
- Compose SMS messages with quick order-value inserts and a Unicode length limit.
- Keep manual SMS requests authenticated, workspace-scoped, and connected to the existing Bulk SMS BD gateway.

### Fixed

- Apply the standard ৳100 delivery charge to public storefront orders below the free-delivery threshold when no shipping zone is selected.


## [0.0.2.4] - 2026-09-12

### Changed

- Shorten the dashboard fulfillment queue tab label from Abandoned Carts to Abandoned.

## [0.0.2.3] - 2026-09-11

## [0.0.2.2] - 2026-09-11

### Added

- Add independent on/off controls for order confirmation and dispatch SMS templates.

## [0.0.2.1] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- Send confirmation SMS when dashboard, storefront, or Social Inbox orders are created in Pending status.
- Avoid sending a duplicate confirmation SMS when an executive approves an order.

## [0.0.2.0] - 2026-09-10

### Changed

- Keep orders sent to Steadfast in Print with their consignment IDs until they are manually moved to Processing.
