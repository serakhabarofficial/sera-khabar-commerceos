# Merchant-Suite

**Merchant-Suite** is the private, single-tenant order management system for **Sera Khabar** — AI-powered order management and social inbox, built with React, Vite, TypeScript, and Supabase.

This is not a shared SaaS instance. It serves Sera Khabar only, using that brand's own Supabase project, integrations, and storefront configuration. See `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` before making changes.

## Features

- 📦 Order extraction and management
- 📊 Order analytics and dashboard
- 📥 Social inbox (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp)
- 🚚 Courier integrations (Pathao, Steadfast)
- ⚡ Railway auto-deploy enabled
- 🔒 Fraud detection
- 🧾 Invoice generation
- 👥 Team management

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Express.js (Node)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root with the following:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
SUPABASE_DB_URL=your_supabase_pooler_connection_string
ADMIN_EMAILS=owner@example.com
POSTHOG_PROJECT_API_KEY=your_posthog_project_api_key
POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY=your_posthog_personal_api_key
POSTHOG_PROJECT_ID=your_posthog_project_id
POSTHOG_HOST=https://app.posthog.com
```

On Railway, also set the Vite public variables so the browser bundle can sign in:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

`SUPABASE_DB_URL` should be the Supabase pooler connection string from
Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → Database → Connection string → Pooler.
Railway often cannot reach Supabase's direct IPv6 database host, so the pooler
string is preferred for startup migrations. You can alternatively set
`SUPABASE_POOLER_URL`, `SUPABASE_DB_POOLER_URL`, `SUPABASE_DATABASE_URL`,
`DATABASE_URL`, or `POSTGRES_URL`.
`ADMIN_EMAILS` is a comma-separated list of existing Supabase Auth users that
should be repaired or promoted to admin on their next sign-in.
`POSTHOG_PROJECT_API_KEY` is used only server-side to forward custom website
tracker events into this deployment's PostHog project.
`POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY` and `POSTHOG_PROJECT_ID` are used only server-side to
query PostHog behavior data for Order Analysis.

### Storefront product workflow

Add and publish or import products from Merchant Suite's Products page. The public storefront reads
the published catalog from Supabase through the Merchant Suite public API, and the catalog response
is not stored in browser or CDN caches. A newly published or imported product appears on the next
live storefront refresh without a storefront redeploy.

The storefront also keeps a build-generated catalog snapshot for fast first paint on new devices.
That snapshot is only an initial fallback. The live API replaces it in the background, and Supabase
remains the source of truth. To refresh the snapshot deliberately, run `NODE_ENV=production npm run
build` in the separate `sera-khabar-storefront` repository and deploy that repository's `main`
branch. Do not copy product rows or image URLs into dashboard source files.
